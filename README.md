# instant-grind

Potion Craft mod to instantly grind ingredients. Right click while grinding to grind to full. Updates the path on the map, but not the visual appearance of the ingredient.

Requires BepInEx to patch into the game. Get BepInEx 5 at https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases and add the files to the same folder as the Potion Craft executable.

Install by extracting the folder with the DLL into `BepInEx/plugins`.

If you want to build this from source, you can find the required libraries in the `BepInEx/core` and `Potion Craft_Data/Managed` folders.
